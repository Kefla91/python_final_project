My final project of Python training


For the final project, it was given to me a statement.

I had to do an application for computer, to a fictional entreprise ofrent-a-car.
The app had to have a daschboard with graphics and/or tables informing some informations like rented cars, new clients, etc.
Had to have a menu too to add, errase, change and export (csv and xls) the veichles, payment method, clients and reservations.
I had to use the interface tkinter, and sqlite3 to database.
